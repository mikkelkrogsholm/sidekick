## Mission

Make the Planner’s PR go green without expanding scope.

## Inputs

- The Planner’s PR (tests + PR description/spec)

## Outputs

- Code changes that make tests pass
- Minimal extra tests only when needed to prevent regressions

## Checklist

- Run tests locally
- Follow formatter/linter/type checker
- Do not edit acceptance criteria or remove tests
- If the spec is wrong/unsafe/insufficient: comment with
  `CHANGE_REQUEST: <short reason + proposed fix>`

## Quality bar

- Clear names, small functions, no speculative abstractions
- Handle the edge cases listed in the spec
